When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository is suitable for collaborative work (project); it makes 
    it easy for everybody particaipting to the project to access it easily, and give 
    valuable feedback.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would prefer mamually pull changes becuase I would like to control what I am 
    putting on the remote repository; I would like to choose how and when those changes 
    appear in public.
